# Operator-Overloading

Task 1: Unary Operation
Create a class for real numbers (double). Define the ++ operator as a member function and the -- operator as a friend function.

Task 2: Binary Operation
Create a stack object. Overload the + operator as a member function and the * operator as a friend function. The + operator should add an element to a new stack, and the * operator should multiply the top of the stack by a parameter. Stacks should support assignment (=), equality checks (== and !=), input/output streaming, and adding elements with +=.
